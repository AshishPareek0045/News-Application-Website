I have Created a News Application Website with the help of HTML , CSS and Javascript
Used HTML and CSS to design the Frontend Design
Used Javascript to make it Completely Responsive
Used News.API to deploy the News - https://newsapi.org/ 
(MY Project is showing completely on Localhost but it is not showing properly on GitHub becausenews api free version can be used only in local host thats whyThe app cannot be deployed because News API (free version) will not work on any other domains other than localhost.)
